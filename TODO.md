# TODO: Fix Search Page Validation

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Analyze the search page HTML and JavaScript code
- [x] Identify that form submission lacks validation for travelers and flight class
- [x] Add client-side validation in search.js to prevent submission without required fields
- [x] Validation alerts user if travelers input is empty
- [x] Validation alerts user if flight class is not selected
- [x] Task completed - users can no longer proceed to search flights without entering required fields

## Followup Steps
- [ ] Test the application by running it and attempting to submit the search form without entering travelers or selecting class
- [ ] Verify that alerts appear and form submission is prevented
- [ ] Ensure the search works correctly when both fields are filled
- [ ] Note: Server startup command needs adjustment for Windows CMD (use separate commands instead of &&)
